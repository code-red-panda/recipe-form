# recipe
A php web form which formats recipe details, ingredients, and steps, as well as calculates macros based on serving size. The output page contains Javascript to copy the recipe to the clipboard.

The format requirements are outlined by Working Against Gravity. I built this tool freely for use by their recipe creators.
